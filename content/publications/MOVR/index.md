**Background:**
Neuromuscular disease (NMD) research is experiencing tremendous growth as a result of progress in diagnostics and therapeutics yet there continues to be a significant clinical data shortage for these rare diseases. To maximize the development and impact of new therapies, the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) created the neuroMuscular ObserVational Research Data Hub (MOVR) as an observational research study that collects disease-specific measures from individuals living with NMDs in the United States.
**Objective:**
This manuscript provides a description of MOVR, participants enrolled in MOVR, and longitudinal data availability.
Methods:
MOVR collects longitudinal data from individuals diagnosed with ALS, BMD, DMD, FSHD, LGMD, Pompe disease, or SMA, and who are seen for care at a participating MDA Care Center. Data are entered from medical records into standardized electronic case report forms (eCRFs). These eCRFs capture participants’ demographics, diagnostic journeys, clinical visits, and discontinuation from the study.
**Results:**
From January 2019 to May 2022, MOVR collected data from 50 participating care centers and 1,957 participants. Data from 1,923 participants who participated in MDA’s pilot registry were migrated into MOVR, creating a total of 3,880 participants in MOVR. Initial analysis of aggregated data demonstrated that 91% of eCRFs were complete. Forty-three percent of participants had 3 or more encounters and 50% of all encounters were 5 months or less from the previous encounter.
**Discussion:**
As a centralized data hub for multiple NMDs, MOVR serves as a platform that can be used to inform disease understanding, guide clinical trial design, and accelerate drug development for NMDs.
